          My bucket list!!

        <h2>1. CAPPADOCIA, TURKEY </h2>
        <p>
        Cappadocia is a living example of just how odd yet beautiful nature can be. It presents a fantasy-like landscape which looks like it’s been plucked out of a fairy tale, alien-like hills and boulders that seem as if they’ve been transported from another planet. The humans who once lived here used the area’s soft stone to create underground shelters, leaving all kinds of weird architectural wonders in their wake. The lunar landscape is stunning on its own, but the countless hot-air balloons that fill up the sky with shades of red, yellow, orange and cream simply take its beauty to the next level. The Goreme Open Air Museum and its rock-cut churches and the subterranean wonders of Kaymakli are among the best things to see in Cappadocia.

        <h2>2. WHITEHAVEN BEACH, WHITSUNDAYS, AUSTRALIA.</h2>
        <p>It’s easy to see why the Whitehaven Beach ranks among the most photographed beaches in the world. The magnificent 7 km stretch of white sand that feels like your own private slice of heaven presents an aura of peace and serenity, letting you experience relaxation at its very best. The beach is accessible via boat from Hamilton Island and the ports of Shute Harbour and Airlie Beach. To enjoy the best view of Whitehaven Beach, make your way to Tongue Point. Time your trip with a low tide and you’ll get to see a mesmerizing fusion of colors that always promises the grandest of views.

        <h2>3. THE FAIRY POOLS, ISLE OF SKYE, SCOTLAND</h2>
        <p>
        You might suddenly start believing in fairies the moment your eyes fall on the Fairy Pool, an ethereal oasis that bewitches visitors with its crystal clear water, picture-perfect scenery and magical atmosphere. The waters are freezing, but if you’re searching for wild swimming adventures, it truly doesn’t get better than this. And if you’re not as adventurous, a mere walk around the area, exploring aqua blue pools, each more appealing than the other, is sure to leave you in high spirits. The place also has its own infinity pool, bounded by a beautiful stone wall!
        </p>
        <h2>4. GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, USA</h2>
        <p>There’s a reason more than 5 million people choose to visit the Grand Canyon each year. It’s one of the most magical destinations on the planet. Irrespective of how much you read about the Grand Canyon, you’re sure to end up being spellbound, for nothing prepares you for the magical sight that this wonder has to offer. Considered to rank among one of the top 7 wonders of the world, this fascinating piece of art feels strikingly familiar, yet entirely unique. Its sheer size leaves you speechless and visiting the canyon during sunrise or sunset leaves you mesmerized because the scenery on display is so serene, so beautiful, so pure. The canyon is divided into three rims, North, West and South, and all three offer incredibly unique experiences. The South Rim is the most visited feature of the Canyon for it hosts a majority of the regions infrastructure, Native American ruins, viewpoints and historic artefacts. However, if you’re after adventure and solitude, the North Rim is where you need to be.

        <h2>5. MACHU PICCHU, PERU</h2>
        <p>And finally there’s the great Machu Picchu, the so-called lost civilization of the Incas. Machu Picchu was built around the year 1450 and was occupied for almost 100 years before the Spanish Conquest. This mesmerizing city was never discovered by the Spaniards and was literally forgotten until the early 20th century, meaning that most of its architectural wonders still remain intact. The hike up the hills is an adventure in itself, and this mysterious city looks most beautiful from the Inca Trail lookout point.
        </p>
        <h2>6. MILFORD SOUND, NEW ZEALAND</h2>
        <p>
        Sydney Opera House, Waitomo Caves, Great Barrier Reef, Sydney Harbor Bridge, you have all kinds of attractions to keep you company while on tour to Australia and New Zealand. However, the moment your visit Milford Sound, everything else pales in view. This 1692m high mountainous fjord is where you see all those Lord of the Rings fantasies come to life, and your first glimpse is likely to leave you with butterflies in your belly. No wonder that Milford Sound attracts more than 500,000 visitors per year. You can visit Milford Sound on foot, via helicopter or via bus tours.
