        <h1>Why I Love Traveling?</h1>
        <p>Why do people decide to leave their beloved home and travel all over the world? Why do 
          some people love travelling more than being at home? Every traveller has her/his own reasons 
          of doing so. The love for travel is the reason why. Here are my reasons why I love traveling so much.</p>
        
        <img src={require('./images/travel-love.jpg')}></img>
        <h2>
          It’s eye-opening
        </h2>
        <p>I have never been one to live in her own little life bubble and forgetting how life works in other 
          places. Even so, traveling is extremely eye-opening. I love to watch how people live in other countries,
          what their traditions are and learn about their traditions and even celebrate with them. It might give you 
          a new perspective on life and make you (more) humble of the life you have. When you’re travelling: you can 
          do anything, you can go anywhere and I am so willing to try new stuff and push my own boundaries because I 
          am in a new place. It gives me more strength and courage to step out of my comfort zone.</p>
        <p>
          It also gives me a perspective on my own life. The life I’m currently living, doesn’t have to be my 
          life forever. There’s so much out there which makes life so exciting. You don’t have to stay in that 
          same position or same country if you’re not completely happy.</p>
        
        <h2>Explore, explore and explore!</h2>
        <p>Along with the eye-opening part, I absolutely love exploring. Every country has its own beauty. 
          Every country has its own story. I love to get to know the story through talks with locals and by 
          looking around the place and getting to know the history. The landscape of a country tells so much 
          without words. Sometimes I’m just in awe, even when no one has spoken. That feeling of admiration, 
          pure happiness, calmness and excitement is something I want to explore every day of my life. I’m 
          naturally very curious and very eager to learn and travelling combines these two perfectly</p>
        <h2>Getting to know yourself</h2>
        <p>Such a cliché, I know. People take a gap year to travel and to “find out who they are.” How 
          many times have you heard it? And as cliché as it sounds, it is true. Traveling gets you out of 
          your comfort zone, especially if you travel alone. You have to let go of your own way of living 
          and adapt to the lifestyle of the destination. The only one who you can really rely on, is yourself. 
          You have to trust yourself and your instincts. This is such a great learning process and you will 
          get to know yourself so well. It might also give you a possibility to reflect on life.</p>
        <p>
        That’s what I did when I was in Bali and I came back such a happier person. I’m always looking ahead 
        of looking back. What’s going on tomorrow, what has to be done for next week, how can I achieve that 
        one goal and WHY did I do that stupid thing two weeks ago. That was my mind for years and years. My 
        journey to Bali and the things I learned from the locals gave me a new perspective. To live by the day. 
        To enjoy everyday to the fullest. To live in the moment. And I have gotten so much better at it and I’m 
        so much happier. Less stress, more happiness. Let’s all embrace the “living in the moment” vibes. We 
        have no control over yesterday, we have no control over tomorrow. We do have control over today, so 
        let’s take full control of our lives.
        </p>
        <h2>Appreciation of your own life</h2>
        <p>The new perspective gave me a new appreciation of life. Sometimes I’m so sucked up in the daily 
          life, that I lose sight of what I have. There really isn’t a place like home and you’ll get to know 
          that when you’re traveling. The simple things you always took for granted don’t seem to be as simple 
          as you thought. Traveling is also a way to connect with your friends and family if they are traveling 
          with you. I have made some awesome memories with my family and friends, that none of us will ever forget. 
          No matter how far apart we are.</p>
          <p>
            A shared experience will bring you closer together. It doesn’t matter if you are travelling with 
            your close family, your boyfriend or girlfriend, your best friend or your group of friends. Travel 
            will deepen your relationship. Travelling is also a great way to build new relationships, doesn’t 
            matter if they are fellow travellers or locals.</p>
        <h2>Escaping “reality”</h2>
        <p>I love the saying that you need to build a great life at home where you don’t need escaping from.
           But don’t we all need to escape sometimes? We sometimes seek things we don’t have in our own life. 
           Simple things like the nicer weather, a nicer scenery or that gorgeous beach. Or more complicated 
           things like freedom, experiences and happiness. I love planning trips ahead because it makes me 
           excited. It does get my mind off things and in some way helps me to  “escape” from my life. That 
           doesn’t mean I’m not happy with my life. I am very happy at home. However, I am very happy while 
           traveling too. To have the best of both worlds is such a blessing.</p>
        <p>
          Travel also has the power to not only give you the freedom, but it also gives you the time to heal. 
          A new place full of new experiences, challenges and exciting things will give your head some time to 
          process. </p>
        <p>
        I feel most alive when I’m traveling. And that’s because of the exact reason I said before: I can either 
        be really sucked up in life or be too busy with thinking back in time or thinking ahead of time. I’m 
        almost forgetting to live. It’s the ultimate awful daily routine. I get up, go to school or work for 
        the day, return home, do some stuff, go to sleep, and redo the entire process the next day. Traveling 
        brings me so much excitement. It doesn’t have a routine. You can’t have a routine while traveling. 
        Everyday is new and you just have to wait and see what the days brings. That’s what I love most. You 
        can hardly plan it.</p>
